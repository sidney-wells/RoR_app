# RoR_app

It was great meeting you on zoom and chatting with you.  I've asked Sara to share our culture doc with you as I think it will give you a sense of what we are like and what's important to us.  And I think it aligns well with some of the things you mentioned you were looking for in a team too.  Also as we discussed here's a coding exercise that we share with our potential candidates.  It helps give us insight into your coding style and ability but also is a great opportunity for you to see what it is like to work in our stack. It's also a fun opportunity to build a small app that does something useful or interesting for you.  Have fun with it!  

Tech Stack
- Ruby on rails
- vue.js
- postgresql
- elasticsearch
- microservices written in rust.    

Please create an application using the rails stack and put it in github and host it on a server so that we can check it out.  The application can do whatever is interesting to you but please consider the following:

1) The application should have an interesting / cool user interface (checkout webpacker and vue.js as those are components we use in our UI)
2) The application should have unit tests and as a bonus integration tests written in rspec (again rspec is what we use as our testing framework)
3) We use postgres as our primary database - so it would be great if you built your app on top of postgres
4) Please host your app somewhere - heroku is great and free for hobby projects like this and has nice documentation,  see: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails6 - and send me a link to the application running there.  

# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
